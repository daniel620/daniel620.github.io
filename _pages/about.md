Hi, I'm Haolan, a master student at Yale University and currently working as a research assistant at Yale Computer Science under the supervision of [Prof. Rex Ying](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/ying-rex/), working on graphs and fact checking (NLP).

Prior to Yale, I received my bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Financial Engineering from Sichuan University China, where I did projects and research in computer vision, computational finance.


**I am actively seeking entry-level positions as a Software Engineer,ML Engineer or Financial Quant Developer.** 

Several of my projects are listed in the [Portfolio](/portfolio) section.

Please feel free to reach out to me via email: <u>haolan.zuo [at] gmail [dot] com</u> or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haolan-zuo-604619244).
