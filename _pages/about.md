Hi, I'm Haolan, a master student at Yale University and currently working as a research assistant at Yale Computer Science under the supervision of [Prof. Rex Ying](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/ying-rex/), working on graph foundation models, hyperbolic learning and trustworthiness of machine learning models. 

Prior to Yale, I received my bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Financial Engineering from Sichuan University China, where I did projects and research in computer vision, computational finance.

**I am looking for a full-time job in machine learning, data science, quantitative finance or related fields.** I am open to opportunities in both industry and academia. 

I am experienced in research, machine learning engineering, data science. Please refer to [Experience](/experience) and [Portfolio](/portfolio) for more details.

Please feel free to reach out to me via email: <u>haolan.zuo [at] gmail [dot] com</u> or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haolan-zuo-604619244).
