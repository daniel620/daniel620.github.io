*With Prof. Barron*

I just finished my last class of information theory with Prof. Andrew R. Barron. It is really a great class and covers many topics engaging to me.

Heard from Prof. Barron that this is the last time he teaches this class before retirement. I am so lucky to have the chance to learn from him.
